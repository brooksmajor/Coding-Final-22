# Brooks Butler Coding Final 2022
<br /> Welcome to my final!
<br /> For this project I created a series of 8 images that use recursion/tiling to generate random dot patterns.
<br /> I was inspired by half tone imagery with the dot patterns and learned how to use recursion for tiling from https://turtletoy.net/turtle/caf7a6e3c3#iterations=0,choice=1 
<br /> 
<br /> 
<br /> The main thing I did not include in the code was was how to control a Dot() Function. Placing a number inside the parentheses changes it's size and you can add a comma and a color code or number to change its appearance
<br /> 
<br /> 
<br /> With each of the images there is a .json file with (x, y) values of the dot placememnt for that specific image. 
<br /> I hope one day to collect the data based on the size of the dots as well as using the (x, y) data for a future project.

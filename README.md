# Brooks Butler Coding Final 2022
<br /> Welcome to my final!
<br /> For this project I created a series of 8 images that use recursion/tiling with Google Colab Turtle to generate random dot patterns. 
<br /> These images are few of many trials and errors. 
<br /> I was inspired by half tone imagery with the dot patterns and learned how to use recursion for tiling from https://turtletoy.net/turtle/caf7a6e3c3#iterations=0,choice=1 
<br /> 
<br /> 
<br /> The main thing I did not include in the code was was how to control a Dot() Function. Placing a number inside the parentheses changes it's size and you can add a comma and a color code or number to change its appearance. This was the first thing I messed around with as well as color. 
<br /> 
<br /> I found that copying the code and changing it in a different cell worked best for my work flow and outcome. It is more organized and I also didn't need to mess with code that created an outcome I liked. The main aspects that I messed with are recursion, scale, dot sizes, color, and diagonal and straight functions.
<br /> 
<br /> With each of the images there is a .json file with (x, y) values of the dot placememnt for that specific image. 
<br /> I hope one day to collect the data based on the size of the dots as well as using the (x, y) data for a future project. 
<br /> 
<br /> I highly suggest opening this file in Google Collab and playing with the diffrent dot sizes, s and l values, and proportions. 
<br /> I also organized the document into forms collapsing the code to better see the image. 
<br /> 
<br /> When creating this generative code, I found that collecting data was the hardest part because it is randomized. Thankfully I got it to work but not without some headaches. I realized that the list needs to be outside of the function.
